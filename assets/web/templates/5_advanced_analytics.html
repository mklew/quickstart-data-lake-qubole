        <h4>Advanced Analytics using Apache Spark</h4>
        <p>
            For business and marketing teams it would be interesting to know which products are most commonly purchased together.
            For instance:
            <ul>
                <li>Make optimizations in marketing campaigns</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To position components together that will generate a stronger lead pipeline.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Use product correlation data</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To help sales for the lesser viewed products.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Recover revenue for the product that was on the top 10 viewed list, but not top 10 sold.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            To answer such questions and gain insights, in this section, we will use <strong>Notebooks in QDS</strong> to:
            <ul>
                <li>Create Apache Spark application in Scala</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use FPGrowth Data Mining algorithm in MLib</li>
                </ul>
                <li>View top 10 two-product combinations frequently purchased together</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notebooks are great for developing applications in Scala, Python, R, running ETL jobs in Apache Spark,
            as well as visualizing the results of SQL in a single, collaborative environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> The default input
            language for a Spark Notebook is Scala and the default context is SparkContext (sc).
        </p>
        <h4>Insights on Product Relationships</h4>
        <p>
            The engine best suited for quick analytics on object relationships is Apache Spark, which is available as a service on QDS.

                                    This will allow us to determine all the <strong>combinations of products across orders.</strong></li>
